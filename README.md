# Stock_Portfolio
Stock Portfolio Tracker is a console-based Java project that simulates stock trading in real time. It allows users to buy and sell stocks, view their portfolio, check balance, and calculate total portfolio value. The program maintains all stock data and transactions in memory while updating stock prices dynamically for each session.
